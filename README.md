#### Week 4 - Friday Challenge

This was a challenge set at the end of Week 4 whilst learning to code at Makers Academy.

The objective was to write a Takeaway program in Ruby.

The features include: 
+ List of dishes with prices
+ Customer can place an order from the list of dishes, quantities and confirming the total cost.
+ If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise customer will receive a text confirming the order and saying that it will be delivered within 1 hour.

#### Run on IRB/Pry
```shell
require './lib/takeaway'
```

#### Technologies used
+ Ruby
+ RSpec
+ Twilio

##### Notes

This challenge is complete, and it's now a working code - but halfway through I stopped doing TDD and just get it to work.
In the near future, I would like to come back and re-do it with TDD approach.
