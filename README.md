Takeaway
---------

#### Week 4 - Friday Challenge

This was a challenge set at the end of Week 4 whilst learning to code at Makers Academy.

The objective was to write a Takeaway program in Ruby.

The features include: 
+ List of dishes with prices
+ Customer can place an order from the list of dishes, quantities and confirming the total cost.
+ If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise customer will receive a text confirming the order and saying that it will be delivered within 1 hour.

#### Run on IRB/Pry
```shell
require './lib/takeaway'
```

#### Technologies used
+ Ruby
+ RSpec
+ Twilio

##### Notes

Features to be added: 

+ To display ordered items so far (when requested)
+ Add ability to cancel order
+ Add a delete function when order is cancelled
+ Add an order confirmation during checkout?
+ A user interface (via Terminal)

At the time of commiting this update, I am now moving on to the next project or challenge whilst at the bootcamp, but I would really love to come back in near future to add more features to this program.
